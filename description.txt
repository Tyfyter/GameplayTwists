World Twists lets you automatically do some of those things youtubers done for videos, like restricting item/equipment use by arbitrary conditions such as not containing e in the name

Usage:
write code which returns true if the item should be disallowed (ex. item.Name.Contains("e"), !item.magic)
available values are
item: the item
player: the player attempting to use/equip the item
everything else that's available from a static context
